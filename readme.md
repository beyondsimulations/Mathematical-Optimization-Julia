# Optimization with Julia

A comprehensive course on mathematical optimization using Julia, JuMP, and HiGHS. This course is designed to take you from basic Julia programming to solving complex optimization problems.

## Course Overview

This course is structured in three main parts:

1. **First Steps**: Basic Julia programming concepts
   - Variables and Types
   - Vectors and Matrices
   - Comparisons
   - Loops
   - Dictionaries

2. **Data Handling**: Working with data in Julia
   - Functions
   - Package Management
   - DataFrames
   - Input/Output Operations
   - Plotting

3. **Optimization**: Mathematical optimization with JuMP
   - Introduction to JuMP
   - Variables and Bounds
   - Constraints
   - Advanced Solver Options
   - Transportation Problems
